👋 Hi, I'm Jim Galvan
Software Engineer | Applied AI & Computer Vision | .NET Microservices | SaaS Founder

I’m a Software Engineer with ~6 years of experience spanning automation, cloud infrastructure, applied AI, and full-stack development. I currently specialize in building scalable .NET microservices and production-grade computer vision systems, with a strong foundation in clean architecture, CI/CD, and cloud-native development.

At Alphatec Spine, I design and deploy deep learning–based computer vision solutions for medical device quality inspection, training and optimizing custom object detection models (e.g., YOLOv8) using PyTorch and OpenCV, while also developing backend microservices with ASP.NET Core (.NET 8).

I’m also the Founder & Software Engineer at NexMenus, a multi-tenant SaaS platform for restaurant menu management. I lead the full product lifecycle—from backend architecture to cloud deployment—using Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, and Stripe, delivering secure, mobile-first, and localized solutions.

My background includes several years in QA Automation and DevOps, where I built automation frameworks and rebuilt CI/CD pipelines from the ground up—experience that strongly informs the reliability and testability of the systems I build today.
